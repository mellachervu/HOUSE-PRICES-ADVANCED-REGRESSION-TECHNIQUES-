## Introduction

People dream about owning the ideal house that satisfies their desired needs while ensuring that they adhere to their budget constraints. Often times, finding the perfect balance between the two is not an easy task, and it demands a considerable amount of searching as well as compromises. This project aims at exploring the use of advanced regression and other analytical techniques, and feature engineering to predict the final price of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges to predict the final price of each home.
