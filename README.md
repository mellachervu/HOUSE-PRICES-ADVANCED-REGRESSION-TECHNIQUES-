# HOUSE PRICES ADVANCED REGRESSION TECHNIQUES

People dream about owning the ideal house that satisfies their desired needs while ensuring that they adhere to their budget constraints. Often times, finding the perfect balance between the two is not an easy task, and it demands a considerable amount of searching as well as compromises. This project aims at exploring the use of advanced regression and other analytical techniques, and feature engineering to predict the final price of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.
 The prediction of the home prices is done as part of the fulfillment of competition requirement on Kaggle. The datasets used for the purpose of this project / competition were provided by Kaggle after registration for the competition. The final submissions made to the competition and ranking awarded to the team were based on the models, predictions and scoring submissions performed on Python. 
Submissions are evaluated on Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price.
